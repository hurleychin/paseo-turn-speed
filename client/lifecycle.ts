/**
 * How a turn becomes known to the plugin and how it ends.
 *
 * A turn arrives either as a live `turn_started` stream event or as an agent
 * snapshot taken while the plugin attaches mid-turn. Its clock must start at an
 * instant the daemon observed, never at a cached handle field: `ref()`
 * snapshots update on the agent channel while turn events arrive on the
 * timeline channel, so reading `handle.activeTurn` right after `turn_started`
 * can still hold the previous turn's start, charging that whole turn to this
 * one (a 2s turn reported as 63s, `whole turn` collapsing toward 0).
 *
 * It ends either as a terminal stream event (authoritative) or, when that event
 * is lost, as a snapshot that says the agent is no longer working. The snapshot
 * only knows that work stopped: it cannot tell a completed turn from a failed
 * or canceled one, so the end it produces is provisional and a later terminal
 * event for the same turn replaces it.
